# CS341
This course advanced techniques in object-oriented programming and data structures, primarily in C++. The course studies implementation and best practices for data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, balanced trees, tries, and others. The course also introduces advanced memory management techniques (including manual allocation) and proper use of pointers. Compare and contrast these techniques with their implementation in other programming languages. 

Project 1: This is a warm-up project that uses standard OOP practices to create a simulation of a race car game.

Project 2: This project implements the 4 pillars of OOP while also ensuring that there is proper memory allocation in a simulator of the card game War.

Project 3: This project requires the implementation of all bit operations. There is also proper memory allocation along with proper bit manipulation.

Project 4: This is an implementation of a doubly-linked-list that is optimized using a two pointer method for proper insertion.

Project 5: This is an implementation of a red-black tree in C++.

Project 6: This project is an implementation of a hashmap that can use linear probing, seperate chaining, quadratic probing, and cukoo hashing.
